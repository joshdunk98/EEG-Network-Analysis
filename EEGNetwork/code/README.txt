The code in this python contains Python script, iPython Notebooks, and MATLAB script. The iPython Notebook were run in Google Colab using the GPU acccelerator. 
The paths used in the code are relative to the user's local machine and where the data is located. Be aware to change the path if you plan to run the code. 

Code will be updated at a later date. Currently, there are some issues with computational time (takes about 1-2 days to run on a CPU). Changes will be made tot he structure and libraries used to speed up computational time.

The data needed to run this code is not provided in this repository as this repository focuses more on the general outline of the code rather than having it be run by others. Data will possibly be added at a later date.
