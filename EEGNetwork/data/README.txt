This folder does not contain the actual data needed to run this code. The data presented are the results of our EEG Network. This includes correlation matrices, heat maps of the correlation matrices, and grey-scale maps of the correlation matrices. It also contains a list of variables needed for Image Classification in MATLAB, specifically the layers and training options for the Deep Neural Network Model.
